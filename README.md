# seq_index_tool

seq_index_tool is (currently) a tool for generating json-formatted index definition files from a csv or tsv file.

It allows import of data in a table format. Top row is used as current header labels. Then, using drag and drop, correctly named header labels can be set. It also allows for adding sequencing adaptors and setting various other data that are needed to generate a correctly formatted index file.

TODO: add support to output Illumina index kit definition files (tsv) that can be uploaded to BaseSpace or on instruments.
